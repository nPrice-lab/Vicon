%% Aim 1: to visualise the variability in the body movements in multiple ways


%% 3D positions of forearm and hand
%% plot selected markers Trajectory during trial with different color (moving video saved) 
P_mks_V(D);

%% plot all markers Trajectory during trial (still picture)
P_mks_P(D);

%% plotting 1D position over time for one or individual markers (e.g. three graphs with axes XT, YT, ZT)
P_1D(D);

 (X positive = from body towards right hand; Y positive = in front of body; Z positive = up) and T is time.







%% Aim 2: to analysing this variability and how it changes across 1)time or 2)throws.
